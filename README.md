CameraPi
========

A web application to control cameras supported by gphoto2 and Raspberry Pi.
Please note this has been developed using a Nikon D3s.

Pre-Requisites:
---------------
- Raspberry Pi
- Python 2.7
- Bottle 0.10
- gphoto2
- A compiled C script to reset the USB port - instructions to compile and create the script can be found here: [http://askubuntu.com/questions/645/how-do-you-reset-a-usb-device-from-the-command-line](http://askubuntu.com/questions/645/how-do-you-reset-a-usb-device-from-the-command-line)


How to use:
===========
There is no installer as such.

Change the settings in camerapi_config.py.  Important settings are:
- usbresetpath - the full path to the compiled C script that you created - don't forget to mark it executable!
- bottle_staticfilepath - Used by bottle, this the full path to whereever you want to serve static files from.
- bottle_* - Other bottle specific settings.

Run the application using:

(sudo) python camerapi.py

Note: I run as sudo because I'm serving on port 80 which is restricted on the RPi.  I run on port 80 because I'm lazy :)
